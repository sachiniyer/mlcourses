*** Problem Being Solved?
Out Of Distribution Detectin (OOD) is a important (described in [[./continual-learning-theoretical.org]]). The paper tries to create better OOD detection by modeling the outputs of a CIL model onto a hyperspherical space. Then, using two loss function (create tight clusters and distribute those clusters away from each other) they create a representation that allows for better OOD.
*** What is an overview of the method?
The representative samples are modeled using a von Misis-Fisher (vMF) distribution which basically just a spherical gaussian distribution with unit norms.

Then, these representative samples are put through two loss functions; dispersion and compactness loss. Dispersion loss optimizes for more angular distance between the distributions, and compactness loss encourages samples to be closer to each other. They also use an exponential-moving-average updating method for the class prototypes (uses a moving average of all embeddings to update the prototype).

Components:
- A neural network encoder - maps input into a high feature embedding set
- A projection head - maps the feature embedding set into a lower dimension feature representation
- Losses - losses are then applied to normalized feature embeddings (and this is our hyperspherical embeddings)

*** What are the key innovations over prior work?
- *"Remark 1":* There is higher inter-class dispersion (due to the explicit dispersion loss) which promotes better ID and OOD separability
- *"Remark 2":* Estimates are made directly through previous samples rather than inference from gradients (which is what techniques like ~ProxyAnchor~ do)
*** What are the metrics of success?
- Better OOD detection than other approaches
*** What are the key results?
- CIDER outcompetes all other approaches. On CIFAR 100-
  - *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positive_rate][False Positive Rate]]:* 46.89 which is lower than all other approaches
  - *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic][Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic]]:* 87.67 which is higher than all other approaches
*** How might this work have long term impact?
This work gives a new method to do OOD detection that outperforms most of the competing algorithms
